# SubSentry – Subscription Tracking MVP

SubSentry is an INR-first subscription tracking application designed to help users
gain visibility and control over recurring digital expenses such as OTT platforms,
SaaS tools, fitness memberships, and cloud services.

The project focuses on defining a clear product scope, designing a metrics-driven
MVP, and delivering a functional prototype that demonstrates the complete core
user journey.

## Problem
Users often lose money due to forgotten subscriptions, silent auto-renewals,
and the lack of a single place to view total recurring spend. Existing solutions
are fragmented, USD-centric, or overly complex for everyday use.

---

## Solution (MVP Scope)
- Manual logging of recurring subscriptions
- INR-first dashboard showing monthly and annual spend
- Renewal and free-trial alerts before auto-debits
- Clean, low-cognitive-load user experience
